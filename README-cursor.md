# InvestSkill for Cursor

Professional investment analysis rules for Cursor IDE: 34 analysis frameworks as universal prompts, plus 3 aliases and the `report-generator` output tool.

**For other platforms**, see [README.md](README.md).

---

## Quick Start

### Install — one command

Run this in the project where you want the frameworks:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yennanliu/InvestSkill/main/install.sh | bash -s -- -a cursor
```

It writes `.cursor/rules/investskill.mdc` (auto-loaded by Cursor) and copies every framework into `.investskill/prompts/`. If a rule file already exists it is appended to, never overwritten; re-running is a no-op. Add `-g` to install for your user instead of one project.

### Or work inside a clone of the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yennanliu/InvestSkill.git
cd InvestSkill
cursor .
```

The repo ships its own `.cursor/rules/invest-skill.mdc`, and the prompts are in `prompts/` — use `@prompts/<name>.md` instead of `@.investskill/prompts/<name>.md` in the examples below.

### First analysis

In Cursor's AI chat:

```
@.investskill/prompts/stock-eval.md Evaluate Apple (AAPL)
```

Or just ask — the rule tells Cursor the frameworks exist:

```
Run the bear-case framework on Tesla
```

## Usage Examples

**Paste your own data** (the most accurate way to work):
```
@.investskill/prompts/financial-report-analyst.md
[paste 10-Q or annual report text]
Extract red flags and management quality indicators
```

**Compare stocks:**
```
@.investskill/prompts/compare.md AAPL MSFT GOOGL — which one, and why?
```

**Review a portfolio:**
```
@.investskill/prompts/portfolio-review.md Review my portfolio:
AAPL 30% · MSFT 25% · NVDA 20% · JNJ 15% · TSLA 10%
```

**Chain frameworks in one chat:**
```
1. @.investskill/prompts/stock-eval.md for NVDA
2. @.investskill/prompts/technical-analysis.md for NVDA
3. @.investskill/prompts/bear-case.md for NVDA
Synthesize into one investment view.
```

**Follow up on assumptions** — Cursor keeps the conversation context:
```
@.investskill/prompts/stock-valuation.md Value Microsoft
→ What if revenue growth slows to 8%? How sensitive is the value to WACC?
```

## Output Format

Every analysis opens with a **Data & Sources** header (as-of date, source, retrieval path, confidence) and ends with the standard Investment Signal block:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              INVESTMENT SIGNAL               ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Signal:      BULLISH / NEUTRAL / BEARISH     ║
║ Confidence:  HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW             ║
║ Horizon:     SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG-TERM      ║
║ Score:       X.X / 10                        ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Action:      BUY / HOLD / SELL               ║
║ Conviction:  STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Troubleshooting

**Rules not loading?**
1. Check the rule file exists: `.cursor/rules/investskill.mdc` (installer) or `.cursor/rules/invest-skill.mdc` (repo clone).
2. Make sure Cursor has that folder open as the workspace root.
3. Restart Cursor.
4. Ask "What InvestSkill frameworks are available?" — Cursor should list them.

**`@` references not resolving?** After `install.sh` the prompts live in `.investskill/prompts/`, not `prompts/`. File names use hyphens (`stock-eval.md`).

**Updating:** re-run the install command; it refreshes `.investskill/prompts/`.

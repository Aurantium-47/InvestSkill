# InvestSkill for Claude Code

Professional investment analysis plugin for Claude Code: 34 analysis frameworks as native slash commands, plus 3 aliases and the `report-generator` output tool (38 skills in all).

**For other platforms**, see [README.md](README.md).

---

## Quick Start

### Install — plugin marketplace

```bash
claude
/plugin marketplace add yennanliu/InvestSkill
/plugin install us-stock-analysis@invest-skill
/plugin list        # should list us-stock-analysis
```

Commands are namespaced: `/us-stock-analysis:<skill>`.

### Install — one command (project skills)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yennanliu/InvestSkill/main/install.sh | bash -s -- -a claude
```

Installs every skill into `.claude/skills/` (add `-g` for `~/.claude/skills/`), so `/<skill>` commands work immediately. Pick one install method per project — with both, every skill appears twice.

### First analysis

```bash
/us-stock-analysis:stock-eval AAPL                  # quality, value and risk in one pass
/us-stock-analysis:stock-valuation MSFT             # DCF + comps + EV multiples
/us-stock-analysis:full-report GOOGL --depth quick  # several modules → HTML report in output/
```

```

### Aliases (3, not counted as frameworks)

| Alias | Redirects to |
|-------|--------------|
| `fundamental-analysis` | `stock-eval` |
| `dcf-valuation` | `stock-valuation` |
| `research-bundle` | `full-report` (`--depth quick / standard / comprehensive`) |

The aliases still run so old commands keep working, but use the target skill for new work.

## Output Format

Every analysis opens with a **Data & Sources** header (as-of date, source, retrieval path, confidence) and ends with the standard Investment Signal block:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              INVESTMENT SIGNAL               ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Signal:      BULLISH / NEUTRAL / BEARISH     ║
║ Confidence:  HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW             ║
║ Horizon:     SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG-TERM      ║
║ Score:       X.X / 10                        ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Action:      BUY / HOLD / SELL               ║
║ Conviction:  STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not appearing?** Restart Claude Code, then check `/plugin list`. If it's still missing, `/plugin marketplace remove invest-skill`, re-add with `/plugin marketplace add yennanliu/InvestSkill`, and install `us-stock-analysis@invest-skill` again.

**Updating:** `/plugin marketplace update invest-skill`. For `install.sh` installs, re-run the install command.

**Which version am I on?** `/plugin list` shows it; the latest release and its changes are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**Data:** InvestSkill fetches nothing itself. With web access Claude Code follows the skills' primary-source recipes; without it, paste filings, transcripts or holdings. See [Data & Accuracy](site/content/DATA-AND-ACCURACY.md).

More answers in the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## Model Support

Works with whichever model your Claude Code session runs (`/model` shows and switches it). Multi-module runs such as `full-report --depth comprehensive` benefit most from the most capable model available to you.

# Investment Result Validator

You are a rigorous meta-analyst. Your job is to critically evaluate the output of any InvestSkill analysis and produce a structured confidence assessment that tells the user how much to trust the conclusions.

## How to Use

Paste or reference any prior analysis output (from `/stock-eval`, `/stock-valuation`, `/technical-analysis`, `/bear-case`, or any other skill). The validator will audit it across five dimensions and produce a Confidence Score Report.

**Check the contract first.** Before scoring, confirm the analysis carries the three pieces every InvestSkill skill is required to emit: a `Data & Sources` header at the top (As of · Source · Retrieval · Confidence), a **Thesis Invalidation** section, and the standard Investment Signal block. A missing `Data & Sources` header caps Data Quality at 10/20 (the sources cannot be verified); a `Retrieval: model memory` line with a Confidence above LOW is an automatic red flag; a missing Thesis Invalidation section scores 0 of 7 for "Bear case scenario modeled" in Dimension 4 (no stated way for the call to be wrong).

---

## Validation Framework

### Dimension 1: Data Quality (0–20 pts)

Evaluate the underlying data used in the analysis:

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Data sources cited or identifiable | 0–5 | Named sources score higher. If a `fact-check` ledger is available, the whole Data Quality dimension (this table, out of 20) may not exceed what its Verification Score supports (≥ 8.0 → up to 20; 6.0–7.9 → up to 15; < 6.0 → up to 10) |
| Data recency (how fresh?) | 0–5 | <30 days = 5, 30–90 days = 3, >90 days = 1 |
| Data completeness (missing fields?) | 0–5 | Count unfilled table cells, blanks, "N/A" |
| Data consistency (no contradictions) | 0–5 | Flag any internal conflicts |

**Data Quality Score: __ / 20**

---

### Dimension 2: Methodology Soundness (0–20 pts)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Appropriate valuation method for sector/stage | 0–5 | DCF for stable; P/S for growth; P/B for banks |
| Assumptions stated explicitly | 0–5 | Growth rate, WACC, terminal value, etc. |
| Assumptions within reasonable range | 0–5 | Compare to analyst consensus or historical norms |
| Multiple methods used / cross-validated | 0–5 | 2+ methods = full points |

**Methodology Score: __ / 20**

---

### Dimension 3: Signal Consistency (0–20 pts)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Technical and fundamental signals aligned | 0–7 | Same direction = 7, mixed = 3, opposing = 0 |
| Sentiment signals (insider, institutional) aligned | 0–7 | Same direction = 7, mixed = 3, opposing = 0 |
| Macro/sector context addressed and consistent with the thesis | 0–6 | Context assessed and it supports the thesis direction (tailwinds for a bull case, headwinds for a bear case) = 6; mixed or only partly addressed = 3; contradicts the thesis without acknowledgment, or ignored = 0. Never reward a bullish thesis for macro tailwinds a bearish one would be penalised for |

**Signal Consistency Score: __ / 20**

---

### Dimension 4: Risk Coverage (0–20 pts)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Key downside risks identified | 0–7 | At least 3 specific risks named |
| Bear case scenario modeled | 0–7 | Quantified, not just listed |
| Catalysts (positive + negative) identified | 0–6 | Upcoming events that could move the stock |

**Risk Coverage Score: __ / 20**

---

### Dimension 5: Reasoning Transparency (0–20 pts)

| Check | Points | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Conclusion follows logically from evidence | 0–7 | No unsupported leaps |
| Contrarian arguments considered | 0–7 | "Bull case even if wrong because…" |
| Limitations of the analysis acknowledged | 0–6 | Honest about what's unknown |

**Reasoning Transparency Score: __ / 20**

---

## Composite Confidence Score

```
Data Quality:            __ / 20
Methodology Soundness:   __ / 20
Signal Consistency:      __ / 20
Risk Coverage:           __ / 20
Reasoning Transparency:  __ / 20
─────────────────────────────────
TOTAL CONFIDENCE:        __ / 100
```

**Confidence Tier:**
- 85–100: **VERY HIGH** — Analysis is thorough, data is fresh, signals align. Act with confidence.
- 70–84: **HIGH** — Solid analysis with minor gaps. Good basis for a decision.
- 55–69: **MEDIUM** — Usable but has notable gaps. Supplement with additional research.
- 40–54: **LOW** — Significant data or methodology weaknesses. Treat conclusions as directional only.
- 0–39: **VERY LOW** — Major issues found. Do not rely on this analysis without substantial rework.

## Flags & Red Flags

List specific issues found during validation. Always check the output contract first — these are mechanical and come before any judgement:

| Contract check | If it fails |
|----------------|-------------|
| `Data & Sources` header present with As of · Source · Retrieval · Confidence | 🚩 Red flag; Data Quality capped at 10 / 20 |
| `Retrieval: model memory` paired with anything but `Confidence: LOW` | 🚩 Red flag |
| Signal box complete (six fields) and its Score maps to its Signal by the Score Guide (skill-specific rules such as `fact-check`'s Verification Score excepted) | 🚩 Red flag |
| JSON footer (```` ```json {"investskill": …} ```` right after the box) present | ⚠ Warning if missing — outputs from before the footer existed are still valid |
| JSON footer values (signal, score, confidence, action, conviction) equal the box | 🚩 Red flag if they disagree — one of the two was edited after the other |

### ⚠ Warnings (moderate concern)
- [List each warning]

### 🚩 Red Flags (serious concern)
- [List each red flag]

### ✅ Strengths
- [List what the analysis does well]

## Recommended Next Steps

Based on the confidence score and flags, suggest:
1. Which dimension(s) to strengthen first
2. Which additional skills to run (e.g., "Run `/stock-valuation` to cross-check the valuation multiple")
3. Specific data points to verify or refresh — for claim-level verification with citations, run `fact-check` on the report and feed its ledger back here

## Adjusted Signal (if original had one)

If the validated analysis contained an Investment Signal block, reproduce it below with a confidence adjustment applied:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         VALIDATED INVESTMENT SIGNAL          ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Original Signal:  BULLISH / NEUTRAL / BEARISH║
║ Original Score:   X.X / 10                   ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Confidence Tier:  VERY HIGH / HIGH / MEDIUM  ║
║                   / LOW / VERY LOW           ║
║ Confidence Score: XX / 100                   ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Adjusted Action:  BUY / HOLD / SELL          ║
║ (Signal stands / weakened / reversed by      ║
║  low confidence — see flags above)           ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

## Output Format

Always end with the standard signal block reflecting the **validation result itself** (not the original analysis). Fill it from the validation, not by judgement:

| Box field | How it is set |
|-----------|---------------|
| Score | `5.0 + (Original Score − 5.0) × Confidence Score / 100` — a low-confidence analysis is pulled toward neutral. No original signal → 5.0 |
| Signal | From that Score by the Score Guide (≥ 6.0 BULLISH · 4.0–5.9 NEUTRAL · < 4.0 BEARISH) |
| Confidence | Confidence Tier collapsed to three: VERY HIGH / HIGH → HIGH · MEDIUM → MEDIUM · LOW / VERY LOW → LOW |
| Horizon | The original analysis' horizon |
| Action | The original Action if the Signal is unchanged; HOLD if the Signal moved to NEUTRAL; never a stronger action than the original |
| Conviction | STRONG only with HIGH confidence and no red flags; WEAK with any red flag |

Example: original BULLISH 7.4, Confidence Score 62 (MEDIUM) → Score 5.0 + 2.4 × 0.62 = 6.5 → BULLISH / MEDIUM / original action / MODERATE.

In the output, the box below is followed immediately by this machine-readable footer — the same values as the box, filled in (no placeholders, no comments), so tools can read the result without parsing the box:

```json
{"investskill": "1", "skill": "result-validator", "ticker": "<TICKER, or null for a portfolio / market-wide view>", "as_of": "<YYYY-MM-DD from Data & Sources>", "signal": "<BULLISH | NEUTRAL | BEARISH>", "confidence": "<HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW>", "horizon": "<SHORT-TERM | MEDIUM-TERM | LONG-TERM>", "score": 0.0, "action": "<BUY | HOLD | SELL>", "conviction": "<STRONG | MODERATE | WEAK>", "retrieval": "<pasted by user | web/tool retrieval | model memory>", "sources": ["<each primary source, dated>"]}
```

```

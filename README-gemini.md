# InvestSkill for Gemini CLI

Professional investment analysis prompts for Gemini CLI: 34 analysis frameworks as universal prompts, plus 3 aliases and the `report-generator` output tool.

**For other platforms**, see [README.md](README.md).

## Quick Start

### Install — one command

Run this in the directory where you start `gemini`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yennanliu/InvestSkill/main/install.sh | bash -s -- -a gemini
```

It appends an InvestSkill block to `GEMINI.md` (your existing content is kept; re-running is a no-op) and copies every framework into `.investskill/prompts/`. Add `-g` to install for your user instead of one project.

### Or work inside a clone of the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yennanliu/InvestSkill.git
cd InvestSkill
gemini
```

The repo's own `GEMINI.md` auto-loads and the prompts are in `prompts/` — use `@prompts/<name>.md` instead of `@.investskill/prompts/<name>.md` in the examples below.

### First analysis

```
> @.investskill/prompts/stock-eval.md Evaluate Apple (AAPL)
```

Or just ask — `GEMINI.md` tells Gemini the frameworks exist:

```
> Use the stock-valuation framework: what's a fair value for Microsoft?
```

## Output Format

Every analysis opens with a **Data & Sources** header (as-of date, source, retrieval path, confidence) and ends with the standard Investment Signal block:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              INVESTMENT SIGNAL               ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Signal:      BULLISH / NEUTRAL / BEARISH     ║
║ Confidence:  HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW             ║
║ Horizon:     SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG-TERM      ║
║ Score:       X.X / 10                        ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Action:      BUY / HOLD / SELL               ║
║ Conviction:  STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Troubleshooting

**`GEMINI.md` not loading?** Gemini CLI reads it from the directory you start in — `cd` to the project first, check the file is there (`head -20 GEMINI.md`), then restart `gemini`.

**`@` references not resolving?** After `install.sh` the prompts live in `.investskill/prompts/` (`ls .investskill/prompts`); inside a repo clone they are in `prompts/`. File names use hyphens.

**Gemini CLI not installed?** See the official [Gemini CLI repository](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).

**Updating:** re-run the install command; it refreshes `.investskill/prompts/`.
